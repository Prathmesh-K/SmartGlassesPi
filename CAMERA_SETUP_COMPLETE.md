# SmartGlasses Pi Camera Setup - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Status Summary

### ‚úÖ WORKING Components:
- **Camera Module**: Fully functional Pi Camera Module 3 (IMX708)
- **Photo Capture**: High-quality 1920x1080 captures
- **File Management**: Auto-timestamped saves to `Camera/Captures/`
- **Integration**: `capture_and_speak()` function in `smartglasses_app.py`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Considerations:
- **OCR (EasyOCR)**: Works but uses significant memory on Pi
- **TTS (Piper)**: Works but memory-intensive for long text
- **Combined Workflow**: May be killed by system on memory-constrained Pi

## Usage

### Basic Camera (Always Works):
```python
from Camera import capture_photo
photo_path = capture_photo()
print(f"Photo saved: {photo_path}")
```

### Full Workflow (Memory permitting):
```python
from smartglasses_app import capture_and_speak
photo_path, audio_path = capture_and_speak()
```

### Individual Components:
```python
# OCR only
from OCR.piOCR import detect_text
text_list = detect_text("path/to/image.jpg")

# TTS only  
from TTS.piper_tts import initialize_piper_voice, synthesise_to_memory
voice = initialize_piper_voice("TTS/en_US-amy-low.onnx", "TTS/en_US-amy-low.onnx.json")
audio = synthesise_to_memory(voice, "Hello world")
```

## Files Created:
- `Camera/pi_camera.py` - Minimal camera capture function
- `Camera/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `Camera/Captures/` - Auto-created photo storage
- `smartglasses_app.py` - Added `capture_and_speak()` function
- `requirements.txt` - Updated with picamera2

## Next Steps:
1. **Camera is 100% working** - Ready for production use
2. For memory-intensive workflows, consider:
   - Processing on a more powerful device
   - Using smaller OCR models
   - Processing images in batches
   - Adding swap memory to Pi

## Test Commands:
```bash
# Test camera only (always works)
python3 simple_camera_test.py

# Test individual components (memory permitting)
python3 test_components.py

# Test full workflow (requires sufficient memory)
python3 test_capture_speak.py
```

Your Pi Camera setup is **COMPLETE and FUNCTIONAL**! üì∏‚ú®
